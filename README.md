# MIDIPad 

(Python Edition)
MIDIPad is a simple MIDI device reader, for Launchpad/APC etc

## Description

This program is inteded to be really quick to impliment in order to get a 
functional prototype for the program. It is written in python, using very 
little optimization. 

## Dependancies & How To Use

--So far
* rtmidi-python
* simpleaudio

Run MIDIPad in python3, currently the port is hard-set in code until a UI or
nicer interface is made

## TO-DO 

Currently the program is being written only to comply with the Akai APC, other
models are untested currently.

Current very janky, and with limited functionality. Standby for better code
